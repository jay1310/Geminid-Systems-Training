## Service Now API ##
In this app we are calling the POST /now/table/incidents api that Inserts one record in the incidents table of the created application in service now developer by passing parameters.
Source repository: https://github.com/shubhamofbce/ServiceNow-Api

I successfully setup the app by cloning it from repository and it took me 30 minutes to complete the setup. 
``` Ticket was created successfully ```

The authorization details and table_api_name is provided in the ``` .env ``` file in this folder.

Initially, it was giving autorization error in node and it was working fine on POSTMAN.
But, there was an issue in the source code.

In username, windows was automatically taking pc name. 

So, on updating the code, it worked correctly.

In the evening session, I presented by work to the instructor by completing all the objectives.
