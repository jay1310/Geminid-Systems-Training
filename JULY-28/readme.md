## Service Now API ##
In this app we are calling the POST /now/table/incidents api that Inserts one record in the incidents table of the created application in service now developer by passing parameters.
Source repository: https://github.com/shubhamofbce/ServiceNow-Api

I successfully setup the app by cloning it from repository and it took me 30 minutes to complete the setup. 
``` Ticket was created successfully ``` 
Initially, it was giving autorization error in node and it was working fine on POSTMAN.
But, there was an issue in the source code.

In username, windows was automatically taking pc name. 

So, on updating the code, it worked correctly.

#### ``` THANK YOU ```
